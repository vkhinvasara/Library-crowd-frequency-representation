# Library-crowd-frequency-representation
This is sample python script for plotting the crowd frequency for a Library checkin/checkout system.
I have converted checkin/out times to their floor hours and then created a bucket for each hour the library is open.
Every time someone visits the library an hour gets added to that bucket of hour.
After that I just plotted a simple bar graph for the hour bucket against the total crowd frequency of that hour.
